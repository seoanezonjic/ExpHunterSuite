<h2> <strong>Data used in this analysis</strong></h2>
<p>Specifically, in this experiment set, known experiment labels are:</p>

<!--begin.rcode
	text <- paste(plotter$hash_vars$sample_classes[-1], collapse = "\n")
	cat("<ul>\n")
	cat(replace_paired_mark(text, "(\\*)(.*)", c("<li>", "</li>")))
	cat("</ul>")
end.rcode-->

<h2> <strong>General description</strong></h2>
<p>This report contains all the functional information that was requested by the options when functional_Hunter.R was executed.
The functional categories can be:</p>

<ul>
<li> KEGG pathways</li>
<li> GO:</li>

</ul>
	+ Biological Process
	+ Molecular Function
	+ Cellular Component
<ul>
<li> Reactome pathways</li>
<li> Custom nomenclature</li>

</ul>

<p>All the functional categories are computed with ClusterProfiler and GO categories are computed also with TopGo.</p>
<p>Some sections will not show if there are not sinficative results. Each category is analysed using Over representation analysis (ORA) and Gene Set Analysis (GSEA).
The ORA method takes a group of significative DEGs (only DEGs, upregulated DEGs or downregulated DEGs) and performs a hypergeometric test for each term of the selected functional category.
In the case of the GSEA method, all the genes are sorted by their fold-change and the algorithm scan which genes with similar fold-change shares a term of the selected functional category.</p>
