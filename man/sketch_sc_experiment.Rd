\arguments{
\item{seu}{Seurat object to sketch.
Default value of 5000, recommended by Seurat tutorials.}

\item{assay}{A string. Name of assay to sketch. Default "RNA".}

\item{method}{A string. Method to use for sketching. Default "LeverageScore".}

\item{sketched.assay}{A string. Name of assay where sketch will be saved.}

\item{cell.pct}{A numeric. Percentage of total cells to consider
representative of the experiment. Default 25, as suggested by sketching
tutorial.}

\item{force.ncells}{An integer. Number of cells to forcibly use in sketch.
NA by default.}
}
\value{
A seurat object with a new sketched assay.
}
\description{
\code{sketch_sc_experiment} determines optimal cell number to sketch seurat assay.
If it is larger than specified minimum, it proceeds with sketching, else it
is skipped.
